# JAM 

Writing with `markdown` is ease,  
writing with `latex` is hell,   
could we make this hell a purgatory and hope for salvation.   

### Just Another Markup

A light description language with an adaptable syntax.
Its functional and object oriented analyse would like to be modular and flexible.

*Syntax*:

```
~~~def:circle

A circle is a curve of constant curvature.

~~~

"""prop:radius

The points of a circle are equidistant to a center

"""

!!!thm:pi

The circonference of a circle is proportional to its radius:

''' C = 2\pi r '''

!!!

```
